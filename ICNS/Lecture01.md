## The CIA Triad
 The CIA triad is essential because it allows for achieving security.

- Confidentiality:
	- Prevent unauthorized discolosure of information
	- Permit authorized sharing of information
- Integrity
	- Prevent unauthorized modification of information
	- Permit authorized modification of indormation
- Availability
	- Prevent unauthorized withholding of information or services
	- Readily permit authorized access to indormation or services
### Confidentiality 
Confidentiality is the property that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or properties. It covers data in storage, during processing and while in transit. Unauthorized access could be intentional or unintentional, and disclosing sensitive data has substantial impact on privacy. Data encryption and access control are services that help to guarantee confidentiality. 
### Integrity 
Integrity means ensuring the authenticity of information, meaning that information is not altered, and that the source of the information is genuine (Authenticity). It also gives protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular action (Non-repudiation for auditability). This property can be compromised both through human errors and attacks, and violating it has an impact on the trustworthiness of resources and services available online. Implementing version control and audit trails are ways to allow an organization to guarantee that its data is accurate and authentic. 
### Availability
Availability is a requirement intended to assure that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users. It can be violated because of infrastructure failures or overloads, power outages or attacks such as DDoS or ransomware. Violating availability means loss of money for a company or even a country, and could mean censorship. Employing a backup system and a recovery plan, and utilizing cloud solutions for data storage are essential for maintaining availability.
### Orthogonality of the CIA properties
The CIA dimensions are not orthogonal, one cannot address one without taking in considerations the otehr two, they are dependent of each other. This entanglement is what makes security inherently complex, the lack of modularity makes standard engeneering problem-solving methods ineffective.
