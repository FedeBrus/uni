### Condifentiality
Unauthorized access to information could be:
- intentional, mostly from the perspective of the attacker
- unintentional, mostly from teh perspective of the victim
It can be guaranteed with:
- Data encryption
- Access control
### Integrity
Integrity can be further split in two sub-components:
#### Authenticity
Authenticity is the property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted.
#### Non-repudiation (for auditability)
Non-repudiation is the protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular action.
Notice how sometimes non-repudiation can invalidate privacy.
